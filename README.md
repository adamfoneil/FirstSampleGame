I've wanted to make 2D games for a long time. I tried Unity, but it's *way* too complicated for what I want to do, and doesn't leverage my C# background enough. Then I came across [Chroma 2D](https://github.com/Chroma-2D), and felt like this is something I can maybe do.

There's quite a lot to learn, and I'm starting from scratch. Fortunately, there are a lot of good [examples](https://github.com/Chroma-2D/Chroma/tree/master/Chroma.Examples) to start with. I've reworked the [KeyboardInput](https://github.com/Chroma-2D/Chroma/tree/master/Chroma.Examples/KeyboardInput) example into something OO-based with my abstract [Entity](https://github.com/adamfoneil/FirstSampleGame/blob/master/Abstract/Entity.cs) class and its derived [Player](https://github.com/adamfoneil/FirstSampleGame/blob/master/Entities/Player.cs) class.

I have a long way to go before anything is "playable."
